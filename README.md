19. We are using ".site" due to it's relation with Niaga Hoster, the provider we are going to use.
20. After you set the domain name and confirmed if the domain's name you choose is available, now it's the time to activate it on Niaga Hoster.
21. Go to https://www.niagahoster.co.id/ and login using the same mail you used both on Github & Netlify.
22. On the main page, enter your domain name.
